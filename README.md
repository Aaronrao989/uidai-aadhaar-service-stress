# UIDAI Aadhaar Data Insights

**UIDAI Data Hackathon 2026**

🚀 **[Live Demo](https://uidai-aadhaar-service-stress.streamlit.app/)** | 📊 Interactive Dashboard

---

## Project Overview

This project analyzes anonymized Aadhaar enrolment, demographic update, and biometric update datasets to uncover meaningful patterns across age groups and regions. The analysis generates actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making in Aadhaar service delivery and planning.

### Key Objectives
- Analyze age-wise enrolment trends and regional variations
- Identify anomalous patterns in biometric and demographic updates
- Generate cross-dataset insights on population stability and mobility
- Support evidence-based policy recommendations

---

## Datasets

All datasets are UIDAI-provided and anonymized, split into ~500K record batches.

| Dataset | Folder | Key Columns |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Biometric Update** | `data/biometric/` | date, state, district, pincode, bio_age_5_17, bio_age_17_ |
| **Demographic Update** | `data/demographic/` | date, state, district, pincode, demo_age_5_17, demo_age_17_ |
| **Enrolment** | `data/enrolment/` | date, state, district, pincode, age_0_5, age_5_17, age_18_greater |

## 🎯 Live Demo

**Interactive Dashboard:** [https://uidai-aadhaar-service-stress.streamlit.app/](https://uidai-aadhaar-service-stress.streamlit.app/)

Explore the analysis through an interactive Streamlit application featuring:
- Real-time data visualizations
- Regional comparison tools
- Age-wise trend analysis
- Anomaly detection views
- Custom filtering options

---

## Methodology

### 1. Data Ingestion & Merging
Consolidate multiple CSV files per dataset into unified dataframes using memory-efficient techniques.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Standardize date formats
- Handle missing/inconsistent values
- Engineer age-wise aggregate features

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis
- State and district-level aggregation
- Temporal trend analysis
- Univariate and multivariate statistical analysis

### 4. Cross-Dataset Analysis
- Compare enrolment patterns with update behavior
- Identify high-mobility vs. stable regions
- Detect anomalous districts requiring attention

### 5. Visualization & Reporting
- Time-series plots, heatmaps, and boxplots
- Interactive dashboards (optional)
- Comprehensive insights report

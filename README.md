# UIDAI Aadhaar Data Insights  
### UIDAI Data Hackathon 2026

## Project Title
**Age-wise and Region-wise Patterns in Aadhaar Enrolment and Update Behaviour**

---

## Overview
This project analyses anonymised Aadhaar enrolment, demographic update, and biometric update datasets provided by UIDAI to uncover meaningful patterns, trends, and anomalies across age groups and regions. The objective is to generate actionable insights that can support informed decision-making and improvements in Aadhaar service delivery and planning.

The analysis focuses on:
- Age-wise enrolment trends
- Regional variations in biometric and demographic updates
- Identification of anomalous districts or states
- Cross-dataset insights indicating population stability or mobility

---

## Datasets Used
The project uses **only UIDAI-provided datasets**, as required by the hackathon.

### 1. Biometric Update Dataset
Folder:
data/biometric/

Example file:
api_data_aadhar_biometric_0_500000.csv

Columns:
- `date`
- `state`
- `district`
- `pincode`
- `bio_age_5_17`
- `bio_age_17_`

---

### 2. Demographic Update Dataset
Folder:
data/demographic/
Example file:
api_data_aadhar_demographic_0_500000.csv

Columns:
- `date`
- `state`
- `district`
- `pincode`
- `demo_age_5_17`
- `demo_age_17_`

---

### 3. Enrolment Dataset
Folder:
data/enrolment/
Example file:
api_data_aadhar_enrolment_0_500000.csv

Columns:
- `date`
- `state`
- `district`
- `pincode`
- `age_0_5`
- `age_5_17`
- `age_18_greater`

---

## Data Characteristics
- Each dataset is split into multiple CSV files due to API pagination limits.
- Each file contains approximately 5 lakh records.
- All files within a dataset share the same schema.
- Files are consolidated programmatically for reproducibility.

## Methodology Summary
1. **Data Ingestion & Merging**
   - All CSV files within each dataset folder are merged into a single dataframe.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Date standardization
   - Handling missing or inconsistent values
   - Feature engineering for age-wise totals

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Univariate, bivariate, and trivariate analysis
   - State-wise and district-wise aggregation

4. **Cross-Dataset Analysis**
   - Comparison of enrolment vs update behaviour
   - Identification of stable vs high-mobility regions

5. **Visualisation**
   - Time-series plots
   - Heatmaps
   - Boxplots for anomaly detection
   - Comparative charts across datasets

---

## Technology Stack
- **Python 3.11**
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- scipy, statsmodels
- scikit-learn (optional forecasting)
- Jupyter Notebook / JupyterLab

Tested on **macOS (Apple Silicon / M4)**.

---

## Reproducibility
To install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
All data processing and analysis steps are documented in Jupyter notebooks to ensure transparency and reproducibility.
Impact & Applicability

The insights generated from this analysis can help:

Identify regions requiring targeted enrolment drives

Detect abnormal update patterns for administrative review

Anticipate Aadhaar service demand across age groups

Support evidence-based policy and operational planning
Disclaimer

This project uses only anonymised and aggregated data provided by UIDAI for the purpose of the UIDAI Data Hackathon 2026. No personal or sensitive information is used or inferred.
